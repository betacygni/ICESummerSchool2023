## Analysis of dust emission in astronomical sources

In this hands-on session we will learn some basics on how to deal with real astronomical data taken with ALMA. We will produce images of a region that was observed at two frequency bands, and we will derive some physical parameters relevant in the study of the dust emission such as the dust mass and the spectral index. For this, we have divided this hands-on session in two different parts: (**a**) producing images, and (**b**) analyzing images.

### Basic requirements

Astronomers use telescopes to observe the sky. However, the data taken by the telescope requires some processing before one obtains a scientific-ready image or datafile. Traditionally, each telescope developes its own software to do this processing. In this hands-on session we will use the [CASA](https://casa.nrao.edu/) software which was developed to be a common processing software for many telescope facilities, in particular, radio telescopes. Among others, CASA can be used to process the data of telescopes such as [ALMA](https://almascience.eso.org/) and [VLA](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla), and other facilities (e.g., [SMA](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/), [NOEMA](https://iram-institute.org/science-portal/noema/), [ATCA](https://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/)) have adapted their procedures to also be compatible with CASA if the user prefers to use this software.
