## Analysis of dust emission in astronomical sources

In this hands-on session we will learn some basics on how to deal with real astronomical data taken with ALMA. We will produce images of a region that was observed at two frequency bands, and we will derive some physical parameters relevant in the study of the dust emission such as the dust mass and the spectral index. For this, we have divided this hands-on session in two different parts: (a) producing images, and (b) analyzing images.
